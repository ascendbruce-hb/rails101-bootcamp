# For practice

This repo is the template for my rails boot camp.

The project objectives are based on the book [Rails 101](https://leanpub.com/rails-101)

# Install

1. Install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or the ruby version manager you familiar with.
2. Install specified ruby version
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `bundle exec rails new .`, answer `Y` when it prompts you to overwrite "Gemfile" due to conflicts
